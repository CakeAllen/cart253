# FrogFrogFrog Variations

## Description

I have made three different variations of FrogFrogFrog:

1. First Person FrogFrogFrog: Puts you in the eyes of the frog trying to snip some flies out of mid-air. 

2. FroggerFroggerFrogger: Turns the game into frogger where you have to cross the road full of moving vehicles to get the flies.

3. Fly Clicker: You get a button and every time you click it, you "eat" a fly. After a few flies, you get upgrades which give you MORE flies.
