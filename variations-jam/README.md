## Description

I have made three different variations of FrogFrogFrog:

1. First Person FrogFrogFrog: Puts you in the eyes of the frog trying to snip some flies out of mid-air. 

2. FroggerFroggerFrogger: Turns the game into frogger where you have to cross the road full of moving vehicles to get the flies.

3. Fly Clicker: You get a button and every time you click it, you collecta fly. After a few flies, you get upgrades which give you even MORE flies. Normally, the player would have to click on the upgrades to get them, but for simplicity's sake, i just made it automatic.
