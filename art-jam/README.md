## Description

My art jam project. I wasn't sure what to do in terms of it being unique so I decided that maybe making a very simple "boss fight" of sorts with my face being the enemy would be cool. 

> Player can use mouse movements to control the player character, and use mouseclick to shoot towards where the mouse is pointing.
> The boss, my face, will have a weak spot that opens and ~~closes depending on when it's attacking. This gives the fight a bit of a risk reward thing.~~ Players can damage the face while the weak spot is closed, but it won't be the ideal maximised damage, but it's good chip damage.
> It has a working HUD, displaying both the face's health bar, but also the players. Furthermore, there's also a game over screen if the player dies, and a ~~victory screen if they defeat the face.~~

> **Unfortunately, a lot of the functionality had to be removed due to me starting this way too late and not being able to polish this enough on time. The only functionality left now is the player can move, shoot, get damaged and die. The boss just sort of sits there with his eyes following the player. He also has his weak spot, a third eye, open and closes after the first hit and nothing else (In result, I buffed the player's damage, even if it doesn't ultimately do anything). There's also no real victory screen...** ðŸ˜”

I have left all of the original code in the js file, I just made them comments so if ever you're interested in seeing what's there, go right ahead.

A lot of it is completely unfinished/has debugging lines so it's not usable even if you uncomment them. 

**You can double click to damage yourself. This is to view that the damage system and the player health bar works.**

I think all the new functions I've used for this project are the mouseClicked function, switch cases, the dist function, the map function and for loops.
