## Description

My art jam project. I wasn't sure what to do in terms of it being unique so I decided that maybe making a very simple "boss fight" of sorts with my face being the enemy would be cool. 

> Player can use mouse movements to control the player character, and use mouseclick to shoot towards where the mouse is pointing.
> The boss, my face, will have a weak spot that opens and closes depending on when it's attacking. This gives the fight a bit of a risk reward thing. Players can damage the face while the weak spot is closed, but it won't be the ideal maximised damage, but it's good chip damage.
> It has a working HUD, displaying both the face's health bar, but also the players. Furthermore, there's also a game over screen if the player dies, and a victory screen if they defeat the face.
