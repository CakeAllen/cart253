# Features
- Has a title screen with a help menu.
- The frog can starve if not enough flies have been eaten.
- There's a chance of a fly being replaced with a rune and the player's goal is to get all 5 runes to win.
- The player wins if they find all 5 runes that spell DECAY.
- Every rune eaten increases the maximum speed of the flies & runes.
- The collected runes will appear on the player's HUD.
- The fly moves in a sine wave with random amplitude.
- Added wings to the fly.
- The frog's eyes follow the present fly/rune.
- The background consists of a gradient from a yellow-ish to black and some ruins with a distant church.
- Added a hunger metre that shows the player how hungry the frog is.
- There's a stamina bar so that the player doesn't spam the tongue and uses it more thoughfully.
- The frog moves smoothly, so that when it stops with the tongue retracted, it doesn't snap to where the mouse is and gets there gradually.
