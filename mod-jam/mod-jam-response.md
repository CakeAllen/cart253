## **Emmett Walthers's "Frog Dude: The Game"**

  I want to start off by saying I really love the overall presentation. The main menu looks like something you'd actually find in a mobile game and the frog looks cute. I also enjoy the idea for the game, giving the frog lanes that it has to move through to eat the flies rather than catching them itself. It's a neat little idea. The added sound effect for when you switch lanes makes the game feel a bit more responsive/satisfying and adds to the "game feel" (as in makes it feel less clunky as you get more stimulus for the action). I also think the code is very nice, clean and legible with all the helper functions used to draw certain shapes.
  
  I just have one nitpick, and that is that I feel like the blue flies that you should avoid being red would've likely been better, but I'm just going to assume there's a lore reason for that. Overall, I really like the simplicity of this one written with nice and organised code.

## **Ray Hernaez's "Froggy, the Avatar"**

  Very unique idea to give the frog elemental attacks which only work with certain types of bugs. Using emojis as the bugs and the projectiles were a nice touch. Each type of fly having their own flying pattern was a good idea for sure. One element that I enjoyed was the effect of passage of time. Every time a bug was defeated, the sky would darken. It really added to the atmosphere, almost as if you're the last one standing protecting the pond. The code is also well done. 
  
  They're not big deals or anything, but I do have a couple of nitpicks. Not really a nitpick as I think it's more of a problem on my end, but the "blue" bug was a red butterfly on my machine. I assume it's not supposed to be, but it was a bit tricky at first to remember that it's supposed to be blue. Another thing is the control scheme for the element switching. I see the vision, but it felt a bit awkward to me. It would lose a bit of "funness" to it but I think using numbers from 1 to 4 or QWER would've been a bit better gameplay-wise, but again not a big deal.

  Despite all that, I really liked this one. It's an idea I hadn't really thought of before so it felt fresh all while being well executed.

## **Kerven-Laurent Casimir's "Flying Frogs"**

  The main menu is pretty incredible. It gives a strong first impression, especially with the stylish buttons. Gameplay-wise I wasn't expecting it to be a borderline horror game. I think not being able to hear the screaming game over screen as well as not being insulted are great incentives to try to live as long as possible in the game. Which isn't the easiest, you definitely have to lock in for a bit. It kind of reminds me of the flappy bird craze from way back in the day. 

  I think the code is nice and clean. I think more helper functions would likely make the whole thing a bit easier to read, but it's not a big deal. This one's really fun, I liked it a lot.

A big takeaway I got from these is that I seriously slacked in the main menu department. :P Usually it's something I do well in, but I put a lot of emphasis on the game actually working before getting any of the UI aesthetics fully right.
